\textbf{Execution Performance.} Our factory detector demonstrates excellent computational efficiency across the entire ground-truth dataset, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:execution_time_distribution}. The execution time distribution reveals that the majority of contracts are analyzed rapidly, with the histogram showing peak frequency in the low-latency range. The cumulative distribution function indicates that 25\% of contracts complete analysis within 1.7 milliseconds, while 50\% achieve detection in 4.7 milliseconds or less. Furthermore, 75\% of all contracts are processed within 24.2 milliseconds, demonstrating the scalability of our approach for large-scale blockchain analysis. The combined visualization of both frequency distribution and cumulative probability provides comprehensive evidence of the detector's computational efficiency across diverse contract bytecode patterns.
