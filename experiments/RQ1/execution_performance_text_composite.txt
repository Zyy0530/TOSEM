\textbf{Execution performance.} Our factory detector demonstrates excellent computational efficiency across the entire evaluation dataset. The execution time analysis reveals that 25% of contracts can be analyzed within 1.7 milliseconds, while 50% of contracts complete analysis in 4.7 milliseconds or less. Furthermore, 75% of all contracts achieve complete factory detection within 24.2 milliseconds, demonstrating the scalability of our approach for large-scale blockchain analysis. The cumulative distribution shows a favorable performance profile with rapid analysis times for the majority of contracts, ensuring practical applicability for real-world factory detection tasks across extensive contract datasets.
